# ROOTPWA #

ROOTPWA is a toolkit for partial-wave analysis of multi-particle final states produced in high-energy particle reactions. Based on experimental and Monte-Carlo data that are read into the program in the form of three-vector tuples and the set of partial waves specified by the user in form of ASCII files, ROOTPWA determines the production amplitudes of the various partial waves by performing an unbinned extended maximum-likelihood fit that uses the full kinematic information of the measured final-state particles and that takes into account detector acceptance as well as reconstruction efficiency. For the calculation of the partial-wave decay amplitudes the helicity formalism is used. The code structure, however, is open for the implementation of other formalisms.

Please note that ROOTPWA is still in development and currently in a transition phase from an old deprecated code basis using a mixture of C++, bash, and ROOT scripts to a new system that is based on C++ and Python. The new system is intended to be faster, more versatile, more flexible, and easier to maintain. The transition will also encompass the migration of the main I/O data formats towards efficient and self-describing ROOT data structures. We will try to minimize incompatibilities and disruptions of workflows that will inevitably occur along the way.

ROOTPWA is distributed under the [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html). For details please see the LICENSE file contained in this package. ROOTPWA is hosted at SourceForge and can be found at

<http://sourceforge.net/projects/rootpwa/>

Below you will find instructions on how to install the external libraries needed by ROOTPWA, how to get the ROOTPWA sources, how to install the program, and how to contribute to the project.


***


# Installation Instructions #


## Prerequisites ##

ROOTPWA will usually run without problems on most (not too old) Linux and MacOS X systems. Regular tests are performed on the latest Ubuntu distribution and MacOS version as well as on the Scientific Linux CERN (SLC) distribution installed on the [_lxplus_](http://plus.web.cern.ch/plus/) interactive login service provided by CERN. Before you can build ROOTPWA you need to install the following software packages.


### CMake ###

CMake is a cross-platform, open-source build system available from <http://cmake.org>. In addition to the [reference documentation](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/documentation.html) available at the project web page further information about CMake can be found at

*   <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake_tutorial.html>
*   <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html>
*   <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/syntax.html>
*   <http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake>
*   <http://rachid.koucha.free.fr/tech_corner/cmake_manual.html>
*   <http://mash-project.eu/wiki/index.php/CMake%3a_Getting_Started>

The minimum required CMake version is 2.8.8. In case your system offers only outdated packages (check CMake version by running `cmake --version`), you can quite easily compile CMake yourself...

1.  Download the latest CMake release from <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>

2.  Prepare the installation

    `> bootstrap --prefix=<install directory>`

    On multi-core machines you may speed up things by using the `--parallel=<# of processes>` option. If you plan to use the CMake GUI, you should set the `--qt-gui` flag. This of course requires that you have the QT libraries installed.

3.  Compile CMake

    `> make && make install`

4.  Add `<install directory>/bin` to your path or create an alias for cmake.

...or use the binary distribution package...

1.  Download the latest CMake binary (`.tar.gz`) from <http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html> and unpack it to your preferred binary directory (e.g. `~/bin/`).

2.  Make sure the binary directory is in your path or create an alias for cmake.


### Boost ###

Part of the code relies on the Boost C++ template library which is available at <http://www.boost.org>. Version 1.56.0 or higher is required; it is recommended to use the latest Boots release. Boost is to a large extend a header-only library so that usually nothing has to be build (noteworthy exception are the Python bindings; see below). Just install the respective Boost packages for your platform or, in case you do not have administrator privileges, extract the source archive to a location of your choice.

The most convenient way to install Boost is to download and extract the tarball of the desired Boost version. However one can also clone the Boost git repository by running

    > git clone --recursive https://github.com/boostorg/boost.git

The list of available versions (tags) is printed by

    > cd boost
    > git tag

As the Boost git repository is split into multiple modules checking out one particular tag is a bit cumbersome. After identifying the tag the checkout has to be performed for the main directory and each submodule. This can be done by (be sure to be in the main Boost directory)

    > cd boost
    > git checkout boost-1.58.0
    > git submodule foreach 'git checkout --force boost-1.58.0 || true'

If you use one of the (optional) features like Python or MPI be sure to recompile the respective Boost libraries after having switched to a different Boost version.

In order to find out the current Boost version (a.k.a. branch tag) run

    > git describe --tags

And accordingly for the submodules run

    > git submodule foreach 'git describe --tags'

You should note though that the tags shown by this command might differ from the one expected in cases where no changes between the tag shown and the one expected were made.

A full update of the Boost git repository can be performed by running

    > cd boost
    > git checkout master
    > git pull
    > git submodule update --recursive --init
    > git submodule update --recursive
    > git submodule foreach --recursive "git checkout master; git pull"


### ROOT ###

ROOT is an open-source data-analysis framework for high-energy and nuclear physics and is available from <http://root.cern.ch>. Version 5.26 or higher is required and it must have been built with the configure options

    `./configure --enable-mathmore --enable-minuit2`

If `root-config --features` does _not_ list `mathmore` _and_ `minuit2` you need to re-configure and re-compile ROOT with these options. See <http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/installing-root-source> for more information in how to compile ROOT from source.


### libconfig ###

We use the _libconfig_ config file parser written by Mark A. Lindner available from <http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/>. Version 1.4 or higher is required. At least for Debian and Ubuntu recent libconfig packages are available, for SLC6 only outdated packages are provided. In case you do not have administrator privileges you can compile libconfig from source which is straightforward. The easiest way is to install the library into the same directory as the source

    > ./configure --prefix=/your/folder/to/install/libconfig
    > make && make install


### yaml-cpp ###

As YAML parser we use _yaml-cpp_ written by Jesse Beder available from <https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp>. Version 0.5 or higher is required. Unfortunately there is no way to check the version in the current release, so please do this manually. Installation from source is quite simple (replace the three variables appropriately)

    > cd ${YAML_CPP_BUILD}
    > cmake ${YAML_CPP_SOURCE} -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${YAML_CPP_INSTALL} -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON
    > make && make install


### Python (optional) ###

In order to make scripting more powerful and flexible, some of the ROOTPWA classes are Python-ified, so that they can be interfaced directly in Python. In the long term much of the house-keeping and user-interface code that is currently scattered across several C++ programs, shell scripts, and ROOT scripts will be reimplemented in Python.

The build system tries to find your Python installation automatically. For this to work you need to have the `python` executable in your path. ROOTPWA requires Python 2.7. In case you do not have the possibility to install the Python 2.7 packages for your operating system, you may install Python from source as outlined below:

1.  Download the source tarball from <http://www.python.org> and extract it to a directory of your choice.

2.  Compile Python.

    `> ./configure --enable-shared && make && make install && make test`

    Depending on whether you have administrator rights or not you might want to set the prefix accordingly (e.g. `` --prefix=`pwd -P` ``). In this case you also have to make sure to add the Python `bin` and `lib` directories to your `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variables, respectively.

In addition you also need to compile the `Boost.Python` library (e.g. by running the supplied `compileBoostLibraries.sh` script). If the build system has found your Python installation and the `Boost.Python` library, the Python features are automatically enabled. Make also sure that the ROOT installation you are using was compiled with Python support (running `root-config --features` should list `python`) against the _same_ Python version you are using (`ldd ${ROOTSYS}/lib/libPyROOT.so | grep -i python` shows you the Python library version against which ROOT was linked). Make also sure that your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable includes `${ROOTSYS}/lib`.


### CUDA (optional) ###

If you have access to a CUDA capable nvidia graphics card (shader model 2.0 or higher), you may want to install the CUDA framework (version 5.5 or higher). The build system tries to find your CUDA installation and, if successful, enables the CUDA features automatically. Make sure that your CUDA environment is setup correctly by adding something like

    `export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/bin:${PATH}`
    `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}`
    (for 32-bit systems: `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-5.5/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}`)

to your `.bashrc`. You have to copy the CUDA samples to a directory of your choice by running

    `cuda-install-samples-5.5.sh <dir>`

Point the environment variable `CUDA_SAMPLES_ROOT_DIR` to the location of the directory with the CUDA samples. If this variable is not set, the build system assumes that the directory is located in `${HOME}/NVIDIA_CUDA-5.5_Samples`.


### MPI (optional, experimental) ###

In order take advantage of the parallel nature of the computing problems in PWA, it is planned to make some of the executables MPI-aware, so that they run on multi-core machines as well as on MPI PC-clusters. The build system tries to find your MPI installation (openMPI recommended) automatically. In addition you also need to compile the `Boost.MPI` libraries (e.g. by running the supplied `compileBoostLibraries.sh` script). If the build system has found both the MPI installation and the `Boost.MPI` libraries, the MPI features are automatically enabled.

## Getting ROOTPWA ##

The ROOTPWA source code is available through the central [git repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/rootpwa/code/) hosted at SourceForge.  In order to get the sources you have to "clone" the repository by running

    > git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/rootpwa/code rootpwa-code

The command will download the code into the `rootpwa-code` directory. This working copy is a git repository of its own which contains _all_ past revisions of the project and which you may use for code experiments. If you plan to contribute code, please read the section "Contributing to ROOTPWA" below.

ROOTPWA is developed in multiple code branches, most of which contain work in progress that might not work as expected. However, there are dedicated stable branches that are intended to be used for real analyses. Tested versions of these branches are identified by tags.

By default you will be in the "master" branch after you cloned the repository. This branch is used for development so users are strongly recommended to switch to a more stable branch. At the moment there is one stable branch called `_v1`. You can get a list of tags for this branch by running

    > git tag | grep <branch name>

The naming scheme for the tags is `<branch name>.<version number>` (e.g. `_v1.12`). In order to get the revision that belongs to a certain tag run

    > git checkout <tag name>

If you are more adventurous and want to get the latest version of a branch, run

    > git checkout -t origin/<branch name>


***


## Building ROOTPWA ##

Finally you are ready to build ROOTPWA from the sources.


### Setting Up Build Environment ###

1.  Make sure that you have installed all the packages mentioned above for the correct architecture: If you compile on a 32 bit machine, _all_ external libraries need also to be compiled for 32 bit. Similarly for 64 bit machines _all_ libraries (including ROOT!) have to be compiled for 64 bit. Mixed 32/64 bit compilation is not supported and will result in linker errors.

2.  Make sure that your ROOT environment is setup correctly. The build system utilizes the `root-config` executable to determine the ROOT environment and expects it to be in the path.

3.  Define the `LIBCONFIG` environment variable and point it to the libconfig installation directory. The build system expects the include files in `${LIBCONFIG}/include` and the libraries in `${LIBCONFIG}/lib`. `${LIBCONFIG}/lib` should be added to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.

4.  If the Boost library was _not_ installed in the system directories you have to tell the build system, where it can find the Boost files by defining the `BOOST_ROOT` environment variable such that it points to the Boost top level directory (e.g. `export BOOST_ROOT=some/path/boost-svn`).

5.  Set the `ROOTPWA` environment variable to the path of the ROOTPWA top level directory. This usually is your git working copy.

ROOTPWA comes with some example `setup*.sh` scripts that define set all the above mentioned environment variables and can be used as templates. You should copy one of them and modify it according to your environment.


### Compiling ROOTPWA ###

1.  We use an out-of-source build strategy (one of the nice features of CMake). This means that all files created by the build system will reside in a separate directory outside of the directories that contain the source code. The build system expects this directory to be `${ROOTPWA}/build` which should already exist in your git working copy.

2.  The contents of the build directory _can be safely deleted_ whenever you feel like it, since it can be _always_ regenerated by (re)starting the build process. This also means that is not a good idea to put any valuable files into the `build` directory or one of its subdirectories. To start the build process run

    `> cd ${ROOTPWA}/build`

    `> cmake ..`

    `> make`

    Note that there is no `make install`.

    If you run on a multi-core machine, you may want to use `make -j` in order to run multiple compilation processes in parallel which usually speeds up the whole process significantly.

    You may influence the build process via four build options:

    1.  `RELEASE`: This is the default.
    2.  `DEBUG`: This generates debug symbols and switches off all optimizations.
    3.  `RELWITHDEBINFO`: This generates debug symbols but uses the same optimization level like `RELEASE`.
    4.  `MINSIZEREL`: This optimizes for minimum binary size.

    You can choose a different build option by using CMake's `-D` option, e.g.

    `> cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG ..`

    `> cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELWITHDEBINFO ..`

    `> cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MINSIZEREL ..`

    CMake will print the compiler flags used in the build process. For debugging purposes you can enable the CMake debug output by running

    `> make VERBOSE=1`

3.  In order to be able to run the ROOTPWA programs you need to add `${ROOTPWA}/build/lib` to your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. It is also a good idea to add `${ROOTPWA}/build/bin` to the path.

4.  If you have doxygen installed on your system you can build a html documentation by running

    `> make doxygen`

    The doxygen documentation will be generated in the directory `${ROOTPWA}/html-doc/html/`. It can be viewed with any web browser, e.g.

    `> firefox ${ROOTPWA}/html-doc/html/index.html`

    This doxygen documentation is also available at the SourceForge project site at <http://rootpwa.sourceforge.net/>. However, it is updated less frequently and might thus be slightly outdated.

    Registered SourceForge project members with the respective permissions can upload the documentation by doing

    `> cd ${ROOTPWA}/html-doc`

    `> sftp <username>,rootpwa@web.sourceforge.net`

    `sftp> cd htdocs`

    `sftp> put html/*`

    `sftp> exit`


### Advanced Compilation Options ###


#### 32bit Compilation ####

The default behavior is that the build system determines, whether it runs on a 32 or 64bit system, and chooses the compilation options accordingly. However, sometimes it is required to compile in 32bit mode on a 64bit platform. This is easily achieved by only slightly modifying step 2 of the above build process

    `> cd ${ROOTPWA}/build`

    `> CXXFLAGS=-m32 cmake ..`

    `> make`

This injects the -m32 flag into all the necessary compiler invocations. Running in 32bit mode you have to make sure, that also _all_ other libraries ROOTPWA is linked against are compiled in 32bit mode. This is usually obtained by running

    `> ./configure --host=i686-linux-gnu "CFLAGS=-m32" "CXXFLAGS=-m32" "LDFLAGS=-m32"`

instead of the normal configure call.


#### Using other Compilers ####

Other compilers like LLVM Clang are supported as long as they understand gcc compiler flags. In order to switch the compiler suite you have to define the environment variables CC and CXX. For example, switching to LLVM Clang would be achieved by executing

    `> export CC=$(which clang)`

    `> export CXX=$(which clang++)`

prior to initializing the build directory by calling cmake.

# Contributing to ROOTPWA #

Contributions to the development of ROOTPWA are very welcome and can be made in several ways:


## Bug Reports / Feature Requests ##

If you find a problem with ROOTPWA or feel that a feature that you would like to have is missing, you can file a [bug report](https://sourceforge.net/p/rootpwa/bugs/) or a [feature request](https://sourceforge.net/p/rootpwa/feature-requests/) on our website. Before submitting a report, please check if your item has not already been submitted by somebody else. Note that you can vote on both bug reports and feature requests if you feel that their resolution is of help to you.

If you already have a solution for a particular bug or have already implemented a new feature, feel free to attach a patch to the corresponding request. The ROOTPWA developers will review your changes and consider them for implementation to the repository.


## Contributing Code ##

If you would like to contribute to ROOTPWA to an extent which would be impractical for patch files, you can fork the ROOTPWA repository. To do this, you need to have a SourceForge account. While logged in, go to the [ROOTPWA repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/rootpwa/code/) and click "Fork" on the left. This will give you your own copy of the ROOTPWA git repository on SourceForge which you can use to implement your contribution. As soon as you judge your work ready for integration, you can issue a merge request by clicking "Request Merge" in your copy of the repository. The ROOTPWA developers will then consider your changes for implementation.

In case you are new to git and need information on how to work with it, we recommend the [git book](http://git-scm.com/book), which gives a thorough and comprehensible introduction to git.

Some information which might be of importance:


### Branch Layout ###

The ROOTPWA repository uses the master branch for development, meaning that the latest development version is generally in the master branch. For older versions, there are maintenance branches name `_v1`, `_v2`, etc. Versions which are deemed stable are tagged with a version number, e.g. `<branch name>.<version number>` (e.g. `_v1.12`). Most work is to be done in topic branches whose name should _not_ start with an `_`. If you are unsure which branch your work should be based upon, feel free to contact the ROOTPWA developers for support.


### Commit Message Format ###

ROOTPWA follows a policy for the commit messages, which is close to the standard git commit message policy. It consists of the following rules:

- The commit message must consist of at least three lines
- The first line of the commit message must not be longer than 80 characters.
- The second line of the commit message must be empty
- All remaining lines (of which there must be at least one) must not be longer than 80 characters.

Please note that the ROOTPWA git repository uses a server hook to enforce this policy. Should any of the commits you would like to see integrated not fulfill these requirements, all of them will be rejected and you will have to re-edit the problematic messages. To reduce problems, there is a git hook in the repository which you can use on the client side to check all the commit messages already when committing. You can install it by running

    > cd $ROOTPWA/gitUtils
    > ./installClientHook.sh

Please note that the `ROOTPWA` environment variable has to be set for the script to work.
